# threedfren v0.1.0
Process 3D images, including MPO files, using this simple Node module

## What is it?
I needed an easy way to batch process MPO files generated by my Fujifilm 3D camera. MPOs
are literally two JPEGs concatenated into one file (LEFT + RIGHT). Support has never
really caught on and I've stuggled to find a decent splitter than can batch process files.

This module gives you some super-simple methods for post-processing of 3D MPO files:

- Easily split into left and right JPEG images
- Convert to side-by-side images with support for parallel and cross viewing
- Create 'triplets' with parallel and cross viewing combined

## Installation

```
npm install threedfren
```

## Usage

In CommonJS projects:

```js
const threedfren = require('threedfren');
```

### Load an MPO image

```js
await threedfren.loadMPO('/path/to/image.mpo');
```
### Split a loaded file into two JPGs

```js
await threedfren.saveSplit('left.jpg', 'right.jpg');
```

### Create a parallel view image

```js
await threedfren.toParallel('output.jpg');
```

### Create a cross view image

```js
await threedfren.toCross('output.jpg');
```

### Create a triplet image

```js
await threedfren.toTriplet('output.jpg');
```
